Truvada,HIV,"I`ve been on truvada daily for more than 5 years. I have had numerous problems tho it has kept my viral load undetectable. Most recent issues are elevated creatine, elevated lipase, UTI`s, nausea, vomiting, bloating. They are slowly ruling out all other causes but I am suspecting it is the meds. I started on truvada, norvir and lexiva but after a few years on that combo my liver began to fail. They stopped the HIV meds then but opted to reintroduce the truvada as it's excreted thru kidneys and added isentress. That was changed to tivicay and truvada which is my current regimen.",2015-10-18,3.0,drugs.com

Truvada,HIV,"I have been on the combination of Truvada/Prezista/Norvir for over 2 years now.  The side effects that cause me the most problems are the ones dealing with my kidneys!

I puked last night and had diarrhea! I felt like death rolled over me so today I call my Hiv doctor and she said it’s to detrimental for you health but she gave it to me for 10  years and when I switched my labs was fine! She’s hates atripla and I guess if it’s people’s last option they die because she won’t give it out! Also she put in my medical records it’s detrimental to my health after she lied to me about it being discontinued!

My quality of life did not improve because I wasn’t living it. I had no energy and was depressed for the longest time.

Atripla,HIV,"I suspected something was wrong, I had the night sweats for about 2 weeks, couple months later, shingles then thrush. Early 2006 I lost close to 100 Lbs and became very sick. I  was told that a former partner of mine had died of HIV pneumonia. Summer of 2006, blood work showed low platelets, and high white blood cells, tested 4 HIV came back as positive I felt floored. My CD4 was around 20 and viral load was off the charts. Full blown AIDS.  I thought I was going to die. I was 38 then. I was put on Atripla, stabilized in 3 months put on a few pounds, 6 months later my CD4 was around 1200 and I was undetectable. Side effects, vivid dreams, nausea.

Triumeq,HIV,"I took Triumeq from early 2016 to early 2017. Although it kept my viral load undetectable, I suffered serious side effects: Bizarre dreams, burping and acid reflux, and serious heart diseases. It caused irregular heart beats, and my heart rates went up to 200 beats per minute when I did light exercises (elliptical) which caused blood pressure to drop so low I collapsed. I also experienced blackout for a brief second several times a day, during walking, sitting, and out of nowhere. I also developed a stenosis on my artery, it's fat buildup in my main blood vessel on my neck that caused my blood flow to drop to 40-50% of normal. And if the fat gets detached and goes into my brain, I will have a stroke.

I do notice till this day if I go hours without eating my stomach will become upset. Even at night sometimes I have pains that wake me up, but as soon as I eat something, even small it goes away.

Side effects, vivid dreams, nausea. Found it easier to take it in the A.M. on an empty stomach. Atripla saved my life, for which I am GRATEFUL. Today in 3-2018, still, undetectable, CD4,1200. I am 50 and pretty much healthy.
Thank you for reading my story. It is so important to get checked EARLY and start  treatment. I didn't and it almost cost me my life.  Hope this helps someone.

Sometimes I had muscle pain. The muscle pain was okay to me. But the diarrhea was really annoying. I have a meal, dinner, a day. I couldn’t understand after toileting in the morning why the diarrhea kept happening even without food. Sometimes I was nervous to go to somewhere if i should drive more than half an hour.

Sometimes I had muscle pain. The muscle pain was okay to me. But the diarrhea was really annoying. I have a meal, dinner, a day. I couldn’t understand after toileting in the morning why the diarrhea kept happening even without food. Sometimes I was nervous to go to somewhere if i should drive more than half an hour.

The worst is the middle weight gain, all around the belly, same gym regime, same dietary consumption but it's this bloated pillow of fat. NOT recommended!

Truvada,PrEP,"My husband and I have been taking Truvada as PrEP for the past 3.5 years. The only symptom we both experienced during the first few weeks was a very localized and nearly constant mild headache located just above and behind the palate - very much like where one would feel a brain freeze, which sensation is far more unpleasant, though of much shorter duration, than the side-effect we experienced when starting of Truvada. The headache wasn't debilitating and we were able to tolerate it without taking pain relievers. Aside from those initial ice cream headaches, we have tolerated Truvada very well and our lab results have always returned normal.

Perhaps the best positive effect we've experienced from taking Truvada every day is an enormous reduction in psychological stress, anxiety and fears about HIV transmission. We learned what undetectable status really means and have been able to overcome the social and sexual stigma of HIV.

Undetectable = Untransmittable!

Truvada,PrEP,"Tried Truvada twice as PrEP, including this spring.  Both times my heart rate went crazy during my regular exercise routines starting about 3 weeks after going on the medication.  I'm discontinuing Truvada again, and hoping my heart returns to normal behavior in a couple weeks, as it did last time.",2017-06-18,,drugs.com
Truvada,PrEP,"I'm been taking Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PREP) now for over 3 years. It's kept me HIV negative, thankfully.  However, the longer I'm on it the more issues I have with sleep and irritability...  I also feel like I'm not very enthusiastic as I was before taking PREP.  This can all be tied to the sleep problems that I feel are a side affect of TRUVADA.  So I'm not completely free of side affects. But I am glad that their is a pill we gay men can take to protect us from HIV.",2017-04-10,4.0,drugs.com

Truvada,PrEP,"I can't believe there aren't Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis reviews here yet!

I've been on PrEP treatment for a little over 6 months and its been uneventful. Nothing, nada, zilch has happened. Except, despite a huge increase in sex. I had a bad hypomanic episode last year that translated into poor choices), I don't have HIV. So, I suppose it's worked! 

No noticeable side effects for me. All blood work (kidneys/etc) are in the normal range.",2015-02-12,4.5,drugs.com
